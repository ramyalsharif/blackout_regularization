# Blackout Regularization
In this project, we propose "Blackout Regularization", a regularization technique for deep learning architectures that supresses connection weights due to penalties assigned by the loss function.

The main purpose of such regularization is to reduce/prevent overfitting.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3.6
Tensorflow
```

### Datasets

For testing, we here use two datasets, namely MNIST and HIGGS dataset. MNIST is downloaded during runtime, HIGGS however, needs to be extracted from the atlas-higgs-challenge-2014-v2.csv.gz in the repository root and renamed to "higgs_dataset.csv"

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
