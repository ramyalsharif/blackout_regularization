# Blackout Regularization
In this project, we propose "Blackout Regularization", a regularization technique for deep learning architectures that supresses connection weights due to penalties assigned by the loss function.

The main purpose of such regularization is to reduce/prevent overfitting.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Python 3.6
Tensorflow
```

### Datasets

For testing, we here use two datasets, namely MNIST and HIGGS dataset. MNIST is downloaded during runtime, HIGGS however, needs to be extracted from the atlas-higgs-challenge-2014-v2.csv.gz to the repository root.
